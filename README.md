# Pyramid sorting and Knuth-Morris-Pratt search

##Description
Implementation of pyramid sorting (HeapSort) and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for searching for subsequences in a deck based on a doubly linked list.

##Project structure
- **Deque** - two-way queue on a doubly linked list
- **HeapSort** - pyramid sorting
- **KMP** - substring search algorithm

##Build and launch
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o heapsort_kmp
./heapsort_kmp
